# Migration Guide â€“ One Mobile SDK â‡’ Verizon Video Partner SDK

We have a new successor SDK going forward. **OneMobileSDK** version **2.30** is the **final** release under this name and repo â€“ we have moved to fully open source and have spun up a new repo. All future changes will be added to [**VerizonVideoPartnerSDK (VVPSDK)**](https://github.com/yahoo/VerizonVideoPartnerSDK-iOS). 

This guide will be helpful for those who want to grab the latest and greatest [**VerizonVideoPartnerSDK**](https://github.com/yahoo/VerizonVideoPartnerSDK-iOS) (formerly **OneMobileSDK**). As a benefit of making the migration - we dropped binary distribution and all sources are distributed as is - so you will no longer need to follow Xcode Swift updates - only the major one's ðŸ˜€.

## Public API

There are, of course, changes in the **Public API**, but there are **NO** changes in terms of functionality if we compare the two *SDKs*.

**Note:** All the SDK **tutorials** have been updated to latest **VerizonVideoPartnerSDK** and are ready for use. You can find them here: [**link to new tutorials**](https://github.com/yahoo/VerizonVideoPartnerSDK-iOS/tree/master/tutorials).

## Migration Steps

The following few changes need to be made in your OneMobileSDK projects:

### 1. Update your **Podfile**:
   - **OneMobileSDK:**
        ```ruby
        source "https://github.com/yahoo/OneMobileSDK-releases.git"

        pod 'OneMobileSDK-Xcode10'
        ```
   - **VerizonVideoPartnerSDK:**
        ```ruby
        # New link to podspec sources
        source 'https://github.com/yahoo/VerizonVideoPartnerSDK-releases-iOS'

        # Renamed SDK pod name
        pod 'VerizonVideoPartnerSDK'
        ```
### 2. Change the import in place where you have used **OneMobileSDK**
   - **OneMobileSDK:**
        ```swift
        import OneMobileSDK
        ```
   - **VerizonVideoPartnerSDK:**
        ```swift
        import VerizonVideoPartnerSDK
        ``` 
### 3. Shorthand `OneSDK` â‡’ `VVPSDK`
   - **OneMobileSDK:**
        ```swift
        OneSDK.Provider()
        ```
   - **VerizonVideoPartnerSDK:**
        ```swift
        VVPSDK.Provider()
        ``` 
### 4. XIB or Stroryboard Module Name (if you are instantiating `PlayerViewController` from XIB or Storyboard)

If you are using `PlayerViewController` in XIB file - you have to rename the module from `OneMobileSDK` to `VerizonVideoPartner` - otherwise the class will not be loaded.
    
**That's it!**
